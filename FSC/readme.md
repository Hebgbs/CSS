# Fullscreen Chat theme
These collections of styles are part of an overarching family of content created via BetterDiscord on Discord Stable, with the intent of making Discord easier to use on smaller displays.  

If you've ever needed to use Discord on a smaller-than-typical display, with either a 4:3 or 5:4 aspect ratio or simply wanted more space in chats for what matters to you â€” the chat text, then you can install this theme and expect for Discord to be easier for use on smaller monitors.  

Currently, the only theme provided is the default one. **This theme requires [Gibbu's horizontal server list](https://github.com/DiscordStyles/HorizontalServerList).** See link for details or install via **[ThemeRepo](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ThemeRepo/).**
